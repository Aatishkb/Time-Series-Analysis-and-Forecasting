## ðŸ•’ Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

This project focuses on building a robust time series forecasting pipeline using both classical statistical models and advanced deep learning techniques. Models implemented include **ARIMA**, **SARIMA**, **Prophet**, and **LSTM**, applied to analyze and predict future values of time series data. The objective is to capture underlying trends, seasonality, and temporal patterns to enhance forecasting accuracy. Comparative analysis of model performance helps identify the most effective approach for reliable and actionable predictions, supporting informed decision-making.

## ðŸ”„ **Project Workflow: Time Series Analysis and Forecasting**

This project follows a structured pipeline to forecast future values in a time series dataset using both classical statistical methods and deep learning techniques.

---

### **1. Problem Definition**

* Identify the objective: forecast future values of a time-dependent variable (e.g., sales, temperature, stock prices).
* Define the scope and evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, MAPE).

---

### **2. Data Collection**

* Source time series data from CSV, databases, or APIs.
* Example datasets: Air passenger data, energy consumption, stock market, weather data.

---

### **3. Data Preprocessing**

* **Handling missing values**: Interpolation, forward/backward fill, or imputation.
* **Datetime formatting**: Ensure time column is in proper `datetime` format.
* **Indexing**: Set the datetime column as the index for time-aware operations.
* **Resampling**: Aggregate data to daily/monthly/etc., if required.
* **Outlier detection and smoothing**: Visualize and address anomalies.
* **Stationarity check**: Use ADF/KPSS tests to check for stationarity.
* **Differencing/transforming**: Apply transformations (e.g., log, diff) to make the data stationary if required.

---

### **4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Plot the time series to observe **trend**, **seasonality**, and **cyclic behavior**.
* Plot **ACF** and **PACF** for autocorrelation structure.
* Decompose the series into **trend**, **seasonality**, and **residuals** using STL decomposition.

### **5. Model Building**

#### A. **Statistical Models**

1. **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**

   * Used for non-seasonal univariate time series.
   * Parameters: (p, d, q).

2. **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)**

   * Extension of ARIMA to handle seasonality.
   * Parameters: (p,d,q)(P,D,Q)s.

3. **Prophet (by Facebook)**

   * Handles trend, holidays, and seasonality automatically.
   * Easy to tune and interpret.

#### B. **Deep Learning Model**

4. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**

   * A recurrent neural network (RNN) variant for sequence prediction.
   * Captures long-term dependencies in time series.
   * Requires data normalization and sequence windowing (sliding window approach).

---

### **6. Model Evaluation**

* Evaluate each model using:

  * **Train-test split** or **cross-validation**.
  * Metrics: RMSE, MAE, MAPE.
  * Visual inspection: Actual vs. Predicted plots.

---

### **7. Model Comparison**

* Compare models based on:

  * Forecast accuracy.
  * Interpretability.
  * Computational cost.

---

### **8. Forecasting and Visualization**

* Generate future forecasts using the best-performing model.
* Plot forecast with confidence intervals.
* Visualize trends and seasonality for insights.

---

### **9. Deployment (Optional)**

* Convert best model to an API using Flask/FastAPI.
* Deploy on cloud (Heroku, AWS, etc.).
* Create dashboards using Streamlit or Dash.

---

### **10. Insights and Conclusion**

* Summarize which model performed best and why.
* Discuss any limitations and potential improvements.
* Highlight business or operational implications of the forecasts.
